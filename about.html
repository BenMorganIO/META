				This app focuses on teaching individuals about facial expressions.
				Research shows that facial expressions are a reliable source for authenticating and identifying a diagnosis, measuring treatment progress, and the response to treatments.
				When evaluating in-patients in an interview with their psychiatrist, facial expressions were also a reliable source for observing later improvement (Ekman, Matsumoto, & Friesen, 2005) and understanding which patients were depressed or suicidal (Heller & Haynal, 2005).
				This app can be used as either studying ones efficiency or deficiency in recognizing facial expressions or by helping people learn to recognize facial expressions more accurately.

                Some scientists have also defined the contempt expression (an asymmetric rising of the lip corner) as a basic emotion, but modern research methods usually do not include the contempt expression, and because of this, this application will not include it either.
                Also, since the contempt expression is asymmetric and requires a self-conscious understanding of morals, it would likely be a self-conscious emotion rather than a basic emotion.
                In the best interest of META, contempt is not included as one of the basic emotions.

			<h4> About Micro Expressions </h4>
			<p>
				Micro expressions are facial expressions with two key characteristics:
            </p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					They have a duration of about approximately 1/15 of a second to about 1/5 of a second; and
				</li>
				<li>
					They are usually expressed as full facial expressions.
				</li>
			</ol>
            <p>
                Here, you can observe the six basic facial expressions:
            </p>
			<ul>
				<li>Happiness</li>
				<li>Sadness</li>
				<li>Anger</li>
				<li>Disgust</li>
				<li>Fear</li>
				<li>Surprise</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Please note that the occurrences of micro expressions are often unfelt.
				Research shows that the shorter the duration of facial expressions, the less likely it is that they have been felt (Ekman, Matsumoto, & Friesen, 2005).
				The ability for one to feel their own facial expressions varies from person to person.
				Facial expressions lasting longer than 4 seconds (for macro) are also often unfelt.
			</p>
			<h4> To the Health Care or Educational Professional: </h4>
			<p>
				To understand a patient's ability in recognizing expressions, it is recommended that they use META Exercise without any training.
				End the session after the patient has viewed approximately 50 expressions.
				The results will show the patients total accuracy, the accuracy for each expression, the total mean duration per expression, and a list of what they have guessed for when they gave a wrong answer.
				This is the Bias List, which can prove useful when dealing with patients who, for example, have Borderline Personality Disorder where research has shown that in BPD the patient often biases facial expressions for a specific emotion (in this case the anger emotion) compared to a control group (Lynch, et al., 2006; Minzenberg, Poole, & Vinogradov, 2006; and Domes, et al., 2008).
				The Duration feature was also implemented because research has also shown that BPDs answer their questions quicker than controls did (Levine, Marziali, & Hood, 1997; Lynch, et al., 2006).
				No other software on the market currently has the bias or duration features.

			    For a quick introduction to the clinical aspects of facial affect recognition, some Anti-Socials had a difficulty in recognizing the fear expression (Deely, et al., 2006; Marsh & Blair, 2008), whereas others had a difficulty in recognizing the disgust expression (Kosson, Suchy, Mayer, & Libby, 2002).
			    Also, Manic Bipolars showed overactivity to the happiness expression, while Depressive Bipolars showed overactivity to the sad expression, but both disorders did show overactivity to the fear expression (Chen, et al., 2006); the reactivity was measured through MRI â€“ how the results would be reproduced through facial affect recognition is going to <em> hypothetically </em> be from increased bias.
			    Schizophrenics had a reduced ability to recognize facial affect, but were more responsive to the fear emotion (Ekman, Matsumoto, & Friesen, 2005).
			    Studies have also shown, surprisingly, that individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder demonstrated the same statistical accuracy as control groups did (Tracy, Robins, Schriber, & Solomon, 2011), while an education in recognizing facial expressions does improve social skills and help manage the symptoms (Russo, Evans-Smith, Johnson, & McKown, 2011).
			    For Panic Disorders, research has shown that there is less amygdala activation to the fear expression (Pillay, Gruber, Rogowska, Simpson, & Yurgelun-Todd, 2006).

			<h4>
				To the Learner:
			</h4>
			<p>
				To learn how to recognize facial expressions efficiently, simply move from the expression to the exercise options by completeing all the sections.
<!--				Completing the Qualitative Expression Section is all that is needed; the Quantitative Expression Section is more focused on educating Mental Health professionals in Facial Affect Recognition.-->
				This app also allows learners <em> not </em> to have the ability to memorize; therefore helping you to learn facial expressions without as many limits as the next leading software.
				There is also the Bias List, which will help you understand, after exercising over a long period of time, which facial expressions you may be having trouble with identifying.
