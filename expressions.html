					As you click through the six basic emotions, you'll be introduced to the selected emotion at its maximum expression.
					Every section teaches you how to recognize the emotion through a qualitative means by presenting the relevant codes from the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) and the relevant muscles used.
					The FACS is a coding system developed to help scientists quantitatively define facial movements through a non-SI dimensional quantity called Action Units (AU).
					The Muscle and AU option will give you the ability to see the expression with the muscles and AUs laid out on top of the selected emotion.

Crow feet form (Naso-Labial Fold) as the cheek rises (Orbicularis Oculi Pars Orbitalis muscle [AU6]). If the expression is intense, the eyebrows will motion downwards due to the movement of the eyes (Orbicularis Oculi Pars Orbitalis muscle [AU4]).

The eyes will also appear relaxed and 'glossy' due to the movement of the upper eyelid corner being raised (Levator Palpebrae Superioris [AU5]).

The nostrils may also be flared, but this is an optional expression (Nasalis Transversa [AU38]).
